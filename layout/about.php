<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>We at Photo Stack vow to offer a place where people can upload, view and purchase photos. Although it may appear to emulate 
other websites, we endeavour to offer a service that is just as good while also being a different one entirely. We think of ourselves as the
Amazon of photography and while we are not nearly as well known or well established, we strive to offer the best photo selling and
auction service that we can be.</p>
